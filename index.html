                    <p>Hello! I am a high school student at The Leffell School in Hartsdale, New York. In my high school years I developed a passion for knitting, and on this website I display all that I have made. It is all for sale, and all proceeds go toward <a href="https://www.lipstickangels.org">Lipstick Angels</a>. Additionally, anything that is not purchased is donated to hospitals. Lipstick Angels is a non-profit organization that provides in-hospital beauty support services to patients undergoing cancer treatments and for those with other debilitating illnesses. I really connect with their mission to make everyone feel beautiful and to lift everyone's self esteem, and for this reason I have supported them for many years. Please reach out for any inquiries at rubyhorowitz@gmail.com.</p>
